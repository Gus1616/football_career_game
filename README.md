# football career game
<p>I love quizzes that have a football career path questions so I made an up app for such questions!</p>

<p>A guessing game whereby users have to guess the soccer players names based on their career path. The user has 90 seconds to get as many players names as possible.</p>

<p>Data scraped from Wikipedia using python package Beautiful soup</p>

<p>Djano REST used as backend</p>

<p>Vue JS used as frontend - Vuex is used to transfer information between components on the front end</p>
